DRAW 10,000 THINGS-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To run my program, you will need to open the "10000 Things" folder and run "10000Things.html". 

PERSONAL TOOLBOX 1-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To run my program, you will need to open the "Personal Toolbox 1" folder (where index.html lives) in Visual Studio Code and use Live Server to run the program. You will need to install the Live Server extension if you do not already have it.

All of the code my program uses can be found in "Personal Toolbox 1/src/main.js". To modify which code my program runs (and thus which SVG is created), simply comment and uncomment one of two chunks of code in the init() method. Each chunk is commented accordingly.

The SVG files this program creates can be found inside the "Personal Toolbox 1/media" folder.

The modified version of the art piece I made used recursion to add a fade effect without using the fill property. The color of each square fades to white when moving from the border of the square towards the center of the square. The difference is subtle unless put side-by-side with the original piece, and I actually like it better that way.

PERSONAL TOOLBOX 2/PERSONAL TOOLBOX 3----------------------------------------------------
To run my program, you will need to open the "Personal Toolbox 2 and 3" folder (where index.html lives) in Visual Studio Code and use Live Server to run the program. You will need to install the Live Server extension if you do not already have it.

All of the code my program uses can be found in "Personal Toolbox 2 and 3/src/main.js". To modify which code my program runs (and thus which SVG is created), simply comment and uncomment one of three chunks of code in the init() method. Each chunk is commented accordingly.

The SVG files this program creates can be found inside the "Personal Toolbox 2 and 3/media" folder.

The modified version of the art piece I made combined Schotter and DesOrdres by putting the recursion from the latter into the iteration of the former.

PERSONAL TOOLBOX 4-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To run my program, you will need to open the "Noise" folder (where index.html lives) in Visual Studio Code and use Live Server to run the program. You will need to install the Live Server extension if you do not already have it.

All of the code my program uses can be found in "Noise/src/main.js". To modify which code my program runs (and thus which SVG is created), simply comment and uncomment two lines of code in the init() method. These two lines are labeled with comments.

The SVG files this program creates can be found inside the "Noise/media" folder.

The modified version of the art piece I made adjusted the color values of the lines drawn based upon the simplex noise pattern generated.

PROJECT 1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run my program, you will need to open the "Project 1 maze of mazes" folder (where index.html lives) in Visual Studio Code and use Live Server to run the program. You will need to install the Live Server extension if you do not already have it.

All of the code my program uses can be found in "Project 1 maze of mazes/src/main.js".

The SVG files this program creates can be found inside the "Project 1 maze of mazes/media" folder.

My code uses two recursive methods to create a maze that contains tiles of other mazes. To spice things up a bit, I made the tails move in directions that differ from the rest of the grid-like lines.
